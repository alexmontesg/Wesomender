1:New Zealand v England. Alastair Cook's side face series defeat:England face a humiliating series defeat after slumping to 90-4 on the fourth day of the third and final Test against New Zealand in Auckland. The tourists lost captain Alastair Cook for 43 and night-watchman Steven Finn to poor shots in the closing stages. England were set a record target of 481 to win in 143 overs. Opener Peter Fulton (110) became only the fourth New Zealander to hit hundreds in the same Test as the hosts declared on 241-6 at Eden Park. England's reply got off to a terrible start when Nick Compton was caught behind off Tim Southee, but they were handed a reprieve when wicketkeeper BJ Watling dropped Cook off a difficult low chance. England appeared to have steadied the ship but then Jonathan Trott swiped at a wide delivery from Neil Wagner and edged to Watling for 37. New Zealand struck their biggest blow when Cook attempted an attacking drive off part-time spinner Kane Williamson and only succeeded in sending a thick edge to slip and was caught for 43. Finn, surrounded by eight close fielders, followed in the day's last over when he rashly reached for another teasing Williamson delivery and was superbly caught at gully for a duck. That left Ian Bell as the not-out batsman, having made eight off 89 balls, and he will need to maintain his defiance on the final day to give England any hope of avoiding defeat.:-36.837866:174.760895:1364188140000:BBC,0.99:New Zealand,Kane Williamson,Peter Fulton,England,Alastair Cook,Jonathan Trott,Steven Finn,BJ Watling
2:Cyprus bailout. Deal reached in Eurogroup talks:Eurozone finance ministers have agreed a 10bn-euro bailout deal for Cyprus to prevent its banking system collapsing and keep the country in the eurozone. Laiki (Popular) Bank - the country's second-biggest - will be wound down and deposit-holders with more than 100,000 euros ($130,000; £85,000) will face big losses. However, all deposits under 100,000 euros will be "fully guaranteed". The European Central Bank had set a deadline of Monday for a deal. Laiki will be split into "good" and "bad" banks, with its good assets eventually merged into Bank of Cyprus. The president of the Eurogroup of eurozone finance ministers, Jeroen Dijsselbloem, told a press conference in Brussels the deal had "put an end to the uncertainty" around Cyprus's economy.He added he was "convinced" the new deal was better for the Cypriot people than the broader measure rejected by the Cypriot parliament last week, as it focused on two problem banks rather than the entire sector. IMF head Christine Lagarde said the deal was "a comprehensive and credible plan" to help restore trust in the banking system. Cypriot Finance Minister Michalis Sarris said he believed the possibility of bankruptcy had been averted. "It's not that we won a battle, but we really have avoided a disastrous exit from the eurozone," he said.:50.11041:8.673084:1364198220000:BBC,0.99:Cyprus,European Central Bank,Jeroen Dijsselbloem,Christine Lagarde,Brussels,International Monetary Fund,Eurogroup,Eurozone
3:Greece is no Ireland, says banking group as bailout stalls:The Institute of International Finance (IIF) has called for more money to be poured into Greece for it to emulate Ireland's success, warning that a failure to do so would end up costing more.Its caution came as talks between Greece and its troika of international creditors - the EU, European Central Bank and International Monetary Fund - were put on hold due to "outstanding issues", largely around clashes over civil service job cuts.Approval from the troika, who will resume talks with Athens in early April, will be needed to release a further €2.8bn to the troubled economy, originally scheduled for the end of March. Despite the delay, Yannis Stournaras, Greek Finance Minister, said he considered the loan tranche as "secure".While in Ireland "consolidation measures have been painful but more manageable politically and socially", the targets set for Greece "were not achievable", said Jeffrey Anderson, senior European director for the IIF in a research note."Applying the Irish example in Greece to help restart growth would require some additional funding," he said, adding that the final cost "would be much less than might eventually be needed if [Greek] output continues to fall and doubts about debt sustainability remain entrenched.":50.11041:8.673084:1363276260000:The Telegraph,0.87:Greece,European Central Bank,Athens,International Monetary Fund,Yannis Stournaras,Ireland,European Union,Institute of International Finance
4:EU finance ministers approve Cyprus bailout deal, avoiding bankruptcy:Cyprus' Parliament president says a 10 billion euro ($13 billion) package of rescue loans secured by his country in tense, last-ditch negotiations is a "painful one," although the bailout saved the country from a banking system collapse and bankruptcy.Yiannakis Omirou said Monday that Cyprus must work fast to reform its economy and leave the bailout as soon as possible.The deal reached in Brussels early Monday prevented Cyprus' imminent financial meltdown by securing the bailout on the condition that the country cut back its banking sector and force large losses on big deposits to help pay much of the bill.Without a bailout deal by Monday night, the tiny Mediterranean nation would have faced the prospect of bankruptcy, which could have forced it to become the first country to abandon the euro currency. That would have sent the region's markets spinning."It's not that we won a battle, but we really have avoided a disastrous exit from the eurozone," said Cyprus Finance Minister Michalis Sarris.The eurozone finance ministers accepted the plan after hours of negotiations in Brussels between Cypriot officials and the so-called troika of creditors -- the International Monetary Fund, the European Commission and the ECB."We believe that this will form a lasting, durable and fully financed solution," said IMF chief Christine Lagarde. To secure the rescue loan package, the Cypriot government had to find ways to raise 5.8 billion euros ($7.5 billion) on its own. The bulk of that money is now being raised by forcing losses on large bank deposit holders, with the remainder coming from tax increases and privatizations. Cyprus must drastically shrink its banking sector, cut its budget, implement structural reforms and privatize state assets, said Jeroen Dijsselbloem, who chairs the meetings of the eurozone's finance ministers. The country's second-largest bank, Laiki, will be restructured, with all bond holders and people with more than 100,000 euros in their bank accounts there facing significant losses.The measures are likely to deepen the recession in Cyprus.The cash-strapped island nation has been shut out of international markets for almost two years. It first applied for a bailout to recapitalize its ailing lenders and keep the government afloat last June, but the political negotiations stalled. After a botched agreement last week, the ECB threatened to cut off emergency assistance to the country's banks."We've put an end to the uncertainty that has affected Cyprus and the euro area over the past week," Dijsselbloem said.That uncertainty around the tiny nation of about 800,000 had shaken the entire eurozone of 300 million people, even though Cyprus only makes up less than 0.2 percent of the eurozone's economy.Several national parliaments in eurozone countries such as Germany must also approve the bailout deal, which might take another few weeks. EU officials said they expect the whole program to be approved by mid-April.The country's second-largest bank, Laiki, will be dissolved immediately into a bad bank containing its uninsured deposits and toxic assets, with the guaranteed deposits being transferred to the nation's biggest lender, Bank of Cyprus.Dijsselbloem said it was not yet clear how severe the losses would be to Laiki's large bank deposit holders, but he noted that it is expected to yield 4.2 billion euros overall -- or much of the money that Cyprus needed to raise to secure the bailout. Analysts have estimated investors might lose up to 40 percent of their money.Large deposits with Bank of Cyprus above the insured level will be frozen until it becomes clear whether or to what extent they will also be forced to take losses, the Eurogroup of finance ministers said in a statement.Dijsselbloem defended the creditors' approach of making deposit holders take heavy losses, saying the measures "will be concentrated where the problems are, in the large banks."The international creditors, led by the IMF, were seeking a fundamental restructuring of the country's outsized financial system, which is worth up to eight times the Cypriot gross domestic product of about 18 billion euros. They said the country's business model of attracting foreign investors, among them many Russians, with low taxes and lax financial regulation had backfired and needed to be upended.The drastic shrinking of the financial sector, the wiping out of wealth through the losses on deposits, the loss of confidence with the recent turmoil and the upcoming austerity measures all mean that Cyprus is facing tough times."The near future will be very difficult for the country and its people," acknowledged the EU Commission's top economic official, Olli Rehn. "But (the measures) will be necessary for the Cypriot people to rebuild their economy on a new basis."Cypriot banks have been closed this past week while officials worked on a rescue plan, and they are not due to reopen until Tuesday. Cash has been available through ATMs, but long lines formed and many machines have quickly run out of cash.Amid fears of a banking collapse, Cyprus' central bank on Sunday imposed a daily withdrawal limit of 100 euros ($130) from ATMs of the country's two largest banks to prevent a bank run by depositors worried about their savings.The Cypriot government also approved a set of laws over the past week to introduce capital controls, in order to avoid a huge depositor flight once banks reopen.Creditors had insisted that Cyprus couldn't receive more loans because that would make its debt burden unsustainably high. The IMF's Lagarde said Cyprus would now reach a debt level of about 100 percent of GDP by 2020.A plan agreed to in marathon negotiations earlier this month called for a one-time levy on all bank depositors in Cypriot banks. But the proposal ignited fierce anger because it also targeted small savers. It failed to win a single vote in the Cypriot Parliament.Cyprus' bid to secure more financial aid from its long-time ally, Russia, then failed, forcing it to turn again to its European partners. Russia was expected, however, to extend a 2.5 billion euro emergency loan granted last year, also lowering the interest rate due and extending the repayment schedule.:35.171283:33.364449:1363276260000:Fox,0.7:Cyprus,International Monetary Fund,Bank of Cyprus,Jeroen Dijsselbloem,European Commission,Olli Rehn,Cypriot,Automated teller machine
5:Jose back at Chelsea. But Rafa has no need to panic... yet!:The Special One is due back at Stamford Bridge for the first time since 2011. But not, as Blues fans hope, to replace the reviled interim boss Rafa Benitez. Not yet anyway. Mourinho has accepted an invitation from the Brazilian FA to tonight's glamorous friendly against Fabio Capello's Russia. So he will be back at Chelsea for the first time since he knocked them out of the Champions League with Inter Milan, two years ago. Mourinho's surprise return to SW6, where he won six trophies between 2004-07, will spark more speculation about him returning for real in the summer. He looks certain to leave current club Real Madrid in the summer. The Portuguese coach has never hidden his love for Chelsea and English football. And only this weekend he hinted he could go back to maybe somewhere I've already been - raising hope among Blues fans he could mean Chelsea. There will be a vacancy, too, as the reign of Benitez ends in May. But Chelsea's billionaire owner Roman Abramovich faces stiff competition. Two-time Champions League winner Mourinho has also been linked with AC Milan, Manchester City and Paris Saint-Germain. Newcastle legend Alan Shearer would be delighted to see Mourinho return. The SunSport columnist said Love him or hate him - and I love him - Jose adds something to the soap opera of English football.If his destiny proves to be Stamford Bridge once more, then it really will be game on with the Manchester clubs.:51.481263:-0.190544:1363222260000:The Sun,0.65:Stamford Bridge,Roman Abramovich,Chelsea FC,José Mourinho,Rafael Benítez,Fabio Capello,Inter Milan,Alan Shearer
6:Mourinho. My passion is England:Real Madrid's coach, Jose Mourinho has said that he aims to return to manage an English Premiership club sometime in the future. Speaking on the Today programme, the former Chelsea manager told guest editor Lord Coe. I'm very very happy to be in Real Madrid. It's a great experience for me. I believe it's probably the biggest club in the history of football. I didn't want to miss a chance to work here. But my passion is England and my next step will be to go back and if possible, go and stay for a long time. And he joked with Lord Coe. Get me a club in a couple of years.:49.190062:-2.11122:1324889700000:BBC,0.99:José Mourinho,Chelsea FC,Real Madrid C.F.,England,Premier League,Today,Real Madrid,Madrid
7:The lonesome king of Spain. how Juan Carlos fell from grace:It is usually a high point of the Mediterranean island's Easter ceremonies. But next Sunday, when crowds gather in the shadow of the vast sandstone walls of Palma de Mallorca's gothic cathedral to greet members of Spain's royal family, there will be a notable absence. Wellwishers accustomed to seeing King Juan Carlos, clutching the hands of one of his eight young grandchildren and flanked by his wife Queen Sofia as he leads out his family following Easter mass, are set for disappointment. For, while the rest of the family decamp this week to the island's royal residence for the traditional Easter celebrations, the 75-year-old monarch will remain at the Zarzuela palace in Madrid where he is recuperating from back surgery. Devoid of close family members at his bedside over the Easter weekend, the monarch must also bear the indignity of having no more than a skeleton staff to serve him. Royal Heritage union members are to execute their first strike in the history of Spain's democracy to protest at austerity measures imposed by the conservative government. The stoppage, over government plans to cut salaries by 15 percent and extended working hours from 35 to 37 hours per week, will be observed by 140 union members, including gardeners, waiters, cooks and valets. However the royals employ a small private staff and it is thought Juan Carlos will be spared the indignity of preparing his own meals.:40.483219:-3.801656:1364112900000:The Telegraph,0.87:Spain,Madrid,Easter,Juan Carlos I of Spain,Zarzuela Palace,Queen Sofía of Spain,Palma Majorca,King Juan Carlos
8:Spanish courts reject paternity cases against King Juan Carlos:Two Spanish courts have rejected demands from the two claimants to make the 74-year old King take a paternity test declaring that under Spain's constitution the monarch cannot be held accountable. Alberto Sola Jimenez, 56, from Catalonia and Ingrid Sartiau, 46 from Belgium, joined forces earlier this year in after learning of each others' claims. Mr Sola was adopted as a young child but claims to have unearthed evidence that suggests his birth mother, a daughter of a well-known banking family, may have had an affair with the King. Mrs Sartiau, from Ghent, claims her mother first met King Juan Carlos in 1956 in Paris and then again in 1966 in Luxembourg where she was conceived. In an interview earlier this year she said. My mother told me who my father was while we were watching television. An image of King Juan Carlos flashed up and she said. 'That man's your father.' The pair met for the first time in June when they underwent DNA tests that show there is a 91 per cent chance that they have one parent in common. They sent a joint letter to Zarzuela Palace, the home King Juan Carlos shares with Queen Sofia informing the monarch of their claims and asking for official recognition. But they received no response and the Royal Household has declined to comment on the matter. They filed a joint request for a paternity test to two Madrid courts on October 9. Both were rejected out of hand by judges because of special protection awarded to the monarch under Spain's constitution. Article 56.3 states that The person of the King is inviolable, and not subject to responsibility. If Mr Sola were to be recognised as the king's illegitimate offspring, he would replace Crown Prince Felipe, 44, as the oldest son. However, as an illegitimate child he would not have a claim to the throne.:40.483219:-3.801656:1351182720000:The Telegraph,0.87:Spain,Juan Carlos I of Spain,Zarzuela Palace,Felipe Prince of Asturias,Royal Household,King Juan Carlos,Catalonia,Ghent
9:Spain frees Turk and 2 Russians arrested on terror charges, for lack of evidence:Spain's National Court has ordered a Turk and two Russians suspected of plotting a terrorist attack to be released from preventive custody for lack of evidence. A court spokesman said Tuesday that Eldar Magomedov and Mohamed Ankari Adamov - Russians of Chechen descent - and Turk Cengiz Yalcin are still suspected of being members of a terrorist group and having possessed explosives but that there is insufficient evidence to keep them in jail while investigations continue. The three were arrested and jailed on provisional charges last August. Spain alleged then they were al-Qaida members and released a video it claimed showed the suspects training for an attack in Spain or elsewhere in Europe using a model plane. The official spoke on condition of anonymity in keeping with court regulations.:40.425887:-3.693085:1364256000000:Fox,0.7:Spain,Al-Qaeda,Model aircraft,Legal burden of proof,Terrorism,Turk,National Court,Eldar Magomedov
10:Cyprus parliament postpones vote on savings levy to Monday:Cyprus's parliament postponed an emergency session called to approve a levy on bank deposits on Sunday after signs lawmakers could block the surprise move agreed in Brussels to help fund a bailout and avert national bankruptcy. In a radical departure from previous aid packages, euro zone finance ministers want Cyprus savers to forfeit up to 9.9 percent of their deposits in return for a 10 billion euro bailout to the island, financially crippled by its exposure to neighboring Greece. The decision, announced on Saturday morning, stunned Cypriots and caused a run on cashpoints, most of which were depleted within hours. Electronic transfers were stopped. The move to take a percentage of deposits, which could raise almost 6 billion euros, must be ratified by parliament, where no party has a majority. If it fails to do so, President Nicos Anastasiades has warned, Cyprus's two largest banks will collapse. One bank, the Cyprus Popular Bank, could have its emergency liquidity assistance (ELA) funding from the European Central Bank cut by March 21. A default in Cyprus would threaten to unravel investor confidence in the euro zone that has been fostered by the European Central Bank's promise last year to do whatever it takes to shore up the currency bloc. A meeting of parliament scheduled for 10.00 a.m. ET on Sunday was postponed a day to give more time for consultations and broker a deal, political sources said. The levy was scheduled to come into force on Tuesday, after a bank holiday on Monday. The levy plan broke a taboo in Europe to leave bank deposits untouched, but euro zone officials said it was the only way to salvage the financial sector, which is around eight times the size of the economy. European officials said it would not set a precedent. In Spain, one of four other states getting euro zone help and seen as a possible candidate for a sovereign rescue, officials were quick to say that Cyprus was a unique case. A Bank of Spain spokesman said there had been no sign of deposit flight. The crisis is unprecedented in the history of the Mediterranean island, which suffered a war and ethnic split in 1974. Anastasiades, elected only three weeks ago, said he had no choice but accept the euro zone's aid terms. We would either choose the catastrophic scenario of disorderly bankruptcy or the scenario of a painful but controlled management of the crisis, Anastasiades said in a statement. With a gross domestic product of barely 0.2 percent of the bloc's overall output, Cyprus applied for financial aid last June, but negotiations were stalled by the complexity of the deal and reluctance of the island's previous president to sign. International Monetary Fund Managing Director Christine Lagarde, who attended the meeting, said she backed the deal and would ask the IMF board in Washington to contribute to the bailout. The proposed levies on deposits are 9.9 percent for those exceeding 100,000 euros and 6.7 percent on anything below that. Those affected will include rich Russians with deposits in Cyprus and Europeans who have retired to the island as well as Cypriots themselves. I'm furious, said Chris Drake, a former Middle East correspondent for the BBC who lives in Cyprus. There were plenty of opportunities to take our money out, we didn't because we were promised it was a red line which would not be crossed. I've lost several thousand, he told Reuters. British finance minister George Osborne told the BBC on Sunday Britain will compensate its about 3,500 military personnel based in Cyprus. Anastasiades's right-wing Democratic Rally party, with 20 seats in the 56-member parliament, needs the support of other factions for the vote to pass. It was unclear whether even his coalition partners, the Democratic Party, would fully support the levy. Cyprus's Communist party AKEL, accused of stalling on a bailout during its tenure in power until the end of February, was likely to vote against the measure. The socialist Edek party called EU demands absurd. This is unacceptably unfair and we are against it, said Adonis Yiangou of the Greens Party, the smallest in parliament but a potential swing vote. Having contributed to bailouts for Ireland, Portugal and Greece - in Greece's case, twice, the second time contributing to a debt restructuring which blew the 4.5 billion euro hole in the banking system that forced it to go for aid -- Europe's treatment has been seen as nothing short of bizarre by many Cypriots. Cyprus received a stab in the back by its EU partners, the daily Phileleftheros said. But it and another newspapers highlighted the danger of plunging the banking system into further turmoil if lawmakers sat on the fence. Even if the final agreement is wrong, if this is not approved by parliament the damage will be even greater, Politis economics editor Demetris Georgiades said in an editorial.:35.167634:33.366852:1363132800000:Fox,0.7:Cyprus,European Central Bank,Nicos Anastasiades,Cyprus Popular Bank,Democratic Party,Christine Lagarde,Middle East,Deposit account

13:Nelson Mandela in Hospital With Lung Infection:Former South African President Nelson Mandela was admitted to the hospital just before midnight Wednesday because of his recurring lung infection, the South African president's office said today. Doctors are attending to him, ensuring that he has the best possible expert medical treatment and comfort, the government's statement said. Mandela, 94, spent 18 days in the hospital in December for a lung infection and gallstones. We appeal to the people of South Africa and the world to pray for our beloved Madiba and his family and to keep them in their thoughts, South African President Jacob Zuma said in the statement. We have full confidence in the medical team and know that they will do everything possible to ensure recovery. The anti-apartheid activist was admitted to a Pretoria hospital March 10 for routine medical tests and to manage existing conditions in line with his age, a spokesman for the South African president's office said. Despite rare public appearances, Mandela, who is credited with changing race relations in South Africa, remains hugely popular in the country. Banknotes featuring Mandela's image were printed and entered into circulation in South Africa in November. After enduring nearly three decades of prison, much of it at hard labor in a lime quarry, Mandela emerged as a gentle leader who was elected South Africa's first black president in 1994. He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his leadership in ending apartheid, and later became a global statesman who inspired millions of people around the world. After he left office in 1999, Mandela became a global statesman, mediating conflicts in some of the world's most troubled spots. Mandela has since retired to his childhood home in Qunu. Occasionally, the government has released photos of the former president after high-profile visitors meet with him.:-25.728777:28.217697:1364428800000:ABC News,0.85:South Africa,Nelson Mandela,Nobel Peace Prize,Jacob Zuma,Qunu,Pretoria,Mandela,Africa

He could not provide a timeline or say how many graves needed to be exhumed. More than 3,000 people died during a five-month power struggle after ex-President Laurent Gbagbo refused to concede defeat in the November 2010 vote.

19:Santander boss planning to appeal court's pardon ruling:Spain's Supreme Court this month partially annulled a 2011 pardon of a conviction held by Saenz, 70, reviving a long-running case. The Supreme Court's ruling two weeks ago has created a headache for Saenz and authorities at the Bank of Spain, which has to decide Saenz's fate as CEO of the euro zone's biggest bank. The Bank of Spain declined to comment on Tuesday. An appeal of the Supreme Court decision could extend the case for several more months, but the courts would first have to decide whether to accept the appeal request. Saenz, who was convicted in 2009 for false accusation against debtors, would appeal to the Constitutional Court, the source said. That is the last recourse for cases that have already been through Spain's Supreme Court. Santander declined to comment and said Saenz was not available for comment. Spain's rules on banking ethics, which define the criteria by which bankers are deemed to be fit and proper, would in most cases bar a person with a criminal record. Saenz must now bear the consequences of his criminal record, even though the cancellation of his three-month jail sentence still stands, the Supreme Court ruled. It blasted Spain's former government for overstepping its powers with the pardon. It was more than the simple pardon of the sentence ... there was an intention to eliminate whatever problem or obstacle there could be to the exercise of the banking profession derived from the existence of a criminal record, the Supreme Court said in its February 12 ruling, which was published on Tuesday. Taking the pardon any further is not only against the law relating to pardons but is also against the constitution. The former socialist government of Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero approved Saenz's pardon in its last cabinet meeting before leaving office at the end of 2011. Saenz would appeal the Supreme Court ruling based on two alleged breaches, of proper legal procedures and of equal treatment under the law, the person familiar with his legal team's thinking said. The source said pending an appeal, Saenz's legal team would ask for the Supreme Court's decision to be nullified. The country's rules on banking ethics, which date back to 1995, are set to change in the coming months, and could end up having a bearing on the Saenz case. Spain is in the process of adopting new rules that would give the Bank of Spain the final say when deciding whether someone can be a banker or not, effectively giving it more flexibility. The Bank of Spain would, however, have to take a court opinion into account, according to a copy of the draft law seen by Reuters.:40.424458:-3.693423:1361861700000:Reuters,0.9:Spain,Bank of Spain,Supreme Court,Saenz,José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero,Supreme Court of the United States,Tuesday
20:Union workers march against austerity in Spain:Hundreds of Spaniards took to the streets in Madrid on Saturday to protest against the economic crisis and European Union pressure to implement austerity measures in the country. Under the slogan Europe is for the people, not the markets the union workers marched from Espana square to Sol square in central Madrid, chanting against PM Mariano Rajoy and the austerity polices introduced by the ruling People's Party. Since taking office in December 2011, Rajoy has announced a series of unpopular measures designed to slash 65 billion euros from the public deficit by 2014. Last year he announced a 3-point hike in the main rate of Value Added Tax on goods and services to 21 percent and cuts in unemployment benefits and civil service pay leading to a second general strike in less than 12 months. The government has trimmed the budget by tens of billions of euros this year and last, cutting public sector wages and limiting health and education spending at a time when the economy is shrinking by an estimated 1.5 percent per year. During five years of economic stagnation and recession, Spain's unemployment rate has risen to 26 percent - the highest level since the 1970s and one of the highest in the European Union. More than half of 18-25 year olds are out of work.:40.416502:-3.703594:1363392000000:Reuters,0.9:European Union,Madrid,Mariano Rajoy,Spain,People's Party,Value added tax,Austerity,Spanish people
21:Cyprus bailout not expected to be euro zone's last -poll:Cyprus probably won't be the last euro zone country to ask for an international bailout, according to a Reuters poll of economists, who cited Spain and Slovenia as the likeliest candidates. The survey also showed no agreement over whether the latest bailout, which hinges on shutting one of Cyprus's biggest banks at a cost to richer depositors, would be better or worse for the financial stability of the euro zone. Cyprus struck a 10-billion euro bailout deal with the European Union and International Monetary Fund on Monday, designed to untwine it from a failed banking sector that has long dominated its economy. Thirty-six out of 48 economists polled this week said other countries will need help to pay their way, too. There were 16 responses naming Spain, and 16 for Slovenia, whose outsized banking industry has drawn comparisons with Cyprus, making it the latest country to fall under the spotlight of the euro zone's debt crisis. The Cyprus deal has brought the European banking crisis to a new level, said Lena Komileva, director of G+ Economics, a research consultancy in London. She said this entailed the return of convertibility risk within the euro zone -- in other words, that euros in Cyprus can no longer be treated the same as euros elsewhere. This represents a uniquely bad deal for the euro's future. Capital controls being prepared by Cyprus are one reason for that convertibility risk. Intended to prevent a run on the banks from depositors anxious to withdraw their savings, the controls effectively render a Cypriot euro less liquid than, say, euros in France, where no such restrictions exist. Still, 38 out of 46 economists said capital controls for Cyprus were appropriate, with the alternative being an uncontrolled exodus of cash from the country. The other eight disagreed. European policymakers have stressed any controls are likely to be temporary, lasting days or weeks. Analysts were less sure. Thirty out of 46 said controls would last months, while 13 expected they would endure a matter of weeks. Three said they could last years. Iceland is still having capital controls, so it might take months if not years in Cyprus before the situation is stabilised, said Peter Vanden Houte, chief euro zone economist at ING in Brussels, referring to the banking crisis that brought Iceland to its knees in 2008. Policymakers have been at pains to point out the latest bailout is tailored for Cyprus after the head of the Eurogroup of euro zone finance ministers Jeroen Dijsselbloem on Monday suggested the bailout could serve as model for dealing with future banking crises. While he later put out a statement that Cyprus was a specific case, economists were split about the wider implications for other countries. Nineteen said the choice to close the country's second-largest bank, rather than recapitalising it, was a better approach for the financial stability of the euro zone. Fourteen disagreed, and 12 said it made no difference. Whilst the approach means that financial sector problems can be dealt with more quickly, which is positive from a long-term perspective, it actually lowers the short-term financial stability, said Elwin de Groot, senior market economist at Rabobank International in Utrecht. It may lead to re-fragmentation between core and periphery and could fuel bank runs if there is merely the perception of a looming bailout. So far there have been few signs savers in Spain and Slovenia, and other struggling peripheral euro zone countries, have been withdrawing cash in response to the Cypriot crisis. Spain's finance minister Luis de Guindos said in an interview on Sunday he had absolutely ruled out asking for international aid to help with its economic problems. Similarly, European Central Bank Governing Council Member Marko Kranjec said last week he was very sure Slovenia, whose central bank he heads, would not follow Cyprus. Among others cited as likely to need a bailout, Italy was mentioned by six. There was a handful of responses for Malta, France, and Portugal, which already has one. The wider poll on European Central Bank policy showed little change in expectations, with interest rates set to remain on hold deep into next year.:50.110245:8.673427:1364443080000:Reuters,0.9:Cyprus,Spain,European Central Bank,European Union,Jeroen Dijsselbloem,Luis de Guindos,Slovenia,London
22:Police. Tanzania building collapse kills 2:A 16-story building collapsed in Tanzania's largest city Friday, killing at least two people and leaving scores injured, police said. At least 17 people suffered injuries and others are feared trapped, said Suleiman Kova, a regional police commander. Authorities believe children at a nearby mosque are among those killed or injured. The building was under construction in Dar es Salaam's central business district. It is unclear whether workers were among the casualties. Rescuers are at the scene scouring for survivors.:6.821955:39.28093:1364559900000:CNN,0.98:Tanzania,Dar es Salaam,Africa,Central business district,Regional police,Government,Embassies and Consulates,Foreign
23:France's Hollande wants 75% payroll tax on rich:French President Francois Hollande made changes to his failed proposal for a 75% top tax rate on Thursday, shifting the burden of payment from individuals to businesses that pay salaries over 1 million euros. Hollande, during last year's presidential campaign, proposed a 75% tax rate on individual income above 1 million euros. The controversial tax was rejected by France's judiciary. Hollande made his new payroll tax proposal on big salaries during a late-night television broadcast. The Constitutional Council made a decision, Hollande said. I respect it. So, I'm going to take a different path. Hollande said the measure is needed to ensure transparency at large corporations -- the only businesses that can afford to pay employees so generously. His initial proposal, which never became law, inspired French actor Gerard Depardieu to abandon the country, instead adopting Russian citizenship and moving to Belgium. Depardieu is a cultural icon in France, and his departure triggered a hailstorm of public comment for and against him. In the United States, Democrats have also made the argument that the rich should pay higher taxes as a matter of fairness. As part of the fiscal cliff deal at the start of this year, the top marginal rate on income was allowed to revert to its pre-2001 level of 39.6%. Hollande's popularity has fallen dramatically in recent months, and the embattled president used the broadcast Thursday to press for more reforms. The French economy, second only in size to Germany in the 17-nation eurozone, has stagnated. Markit economist Jack Kennedy said last month that France's performance in the first quarter of 2013 was shaping up to be the worst since 2009. The broad-based weakness across manufacturing and services leaves scant room for optimism, with a range of indicators from new orders, backlogs, employment and output prices all residing at depressed levels, he said. Germany, by contrast, saw a further improvement in business activity in February for a third month running, although the pace of expansion slowed slightly. Markit said the gap in performance between the eurozone's leading economies was at its widest since surveys began in 1998. France was beginning to look like it belonged to the group of economies on the eurozone periphery, rather than the core, it said.:48.870262:2.316699:1364537400000:CNN,0.98:United States,France,Germany,Markit,Hollande,President of France,Gérard Depardieu,Economy of France
24:Pope Francis washes youths' feet at detention center:Pope Francis washed the feet of a dozen prisoners, including young women, at a youth detention center in Rome as part of a Holy Thursday Mass ahead of Easter. The pontiff poured water over the young offenders' feet, wiped them with a white towel and kissed them. The act of foot-washing at the Mass of the Lord's Supper is part of the Christian tradition that mirrors Jesus' washing of his disciples' feet. Francis' decision to celebrate the Mass with young offenders at the Casal del Marmo center represents a break with tradition but is in step with his record in embracing simplicity and humility. The service has in past years been held at the grand Basilica of St. John Lateran, the official seat of the bishop of Rome. This time, the Mass will be, by his express desire, very simple, the Vatican said before the service. The young offenders were expected to give the pope a wooden crucifix and kneeler, which they made themselves in the detention center's workshop. In return, Francis was to bring Easter eggs and colomba, traditional Italian Easter cake in the shape of a dove, for all, the Vatican had said. The Casal del Marmo center houses close to 50 inmates, who range in age from 14 to 21. The young people who had their feet washed were chosen from different nationalities and diverse religious backgrounds. Two young women and two Muslims were included in the rite, according to the Vatican. Why is the pope washing prisoners' feet? More than 2,000 cardinals, archbishops, bishops and priests, as well as more than 10,000 of the Roman Catholic faithful, joined the pope in celebrating Mass in St. Peter's Basilica on Thursday morning. Francis urged the priests to be close to their congregations and listen to their everyday concerns, even if those concerns sometimes appear material or mundane. The priests should be shepherds who have the smell of their sheep, he said.Francis was installed as pope 10 days ago, having been elected to fill the shoes of Benedict XVI. Since taking on the role, he has focused on a message of helping the poor and needy. In his first general audience Wednesday, before crowds gathered in St. Peter's Square, he spoke of how following Christ means learning to come out of ourselves ... in order to meet others, in order to go toward the edges of our existence, to take the first steps towards our brothers and sisters, especially those who are farthest from us, those who are forgotten, those who need understanding, consolation and assistance. He also called for an end to the violence in the Central African Republic, where a coalition of rebels ousted President Francois Bozize this week. All those suffering in the African nation are in his prayers, he said. I call for an immediate halt to the violence and looting, and that a political solution to the crisis may be reached as soon as possible so that peace and harmony may be restored in that dear country, which has, for too long, been marked by conflict and division, he said. The Holy Week services will culminate on Easter Sunday with the pope's first Urbi et Orbi blessing, directed to the city of Rome and to the world.:41.937443:12.393619:1364514360000:CNN,0.98:Easter,Rome,Central African Republic,Urbi et Orbi,Mass of the Lord's Supper,Vatican,Francis,Peter
25:Al-Qaida unit in Mali says it has killed French hostage:Al-Qaida's North African wing, al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb (Aqim), claimed to have killed a French hostage captured in northern Mali two years ago and its other French captives were at risk because of France's intervention there, Mauritania's ANI news agency said on Sunday. All the other hostages are alive, Aqim said in a communique seemingly addressed to the French people and quoted by ANI, which often receives Aqim statements. But we cannot guarantee their survival for ever because of the attacks by your army on the mujahideen's bases. ANI reported last week that an Aqim member had said its fighters beheaded Philippe Verdon, who was seized in northern Mali in November 2011, on 10 March. Algeria's Ennahar TV reported that Algerian Djamel Okacha, also known as Yahia Abu El Hamam, has replaced Abdelhamid Abou Zeid as the leader of Aqim in the Sahara region. Abou Zeid was killed by Chadian soldiers in northern Mali a few weeks ago. Okacha joined Aqim in northern Mali in 2004, a security source with knowledge of the group said. He was present at the attack against a military barracks in Mauritania in 2005, and he was also present in the killing of an American in 2009, the source said, referring to aid worker Christopher Leggett. Okacha, 34, is close to Aqim leader Abdelmalek Droukdel, also known as Abu Musab Abdel Wadoud, as they belong to the Group of Algiers, a reference to militants born in the capital region. Okacha is Droukdel's right hand. They have spent 12 years together in the north, before Okacha joined the south, the security source said. Okacha's priority is to reorganise Aqim after it registered the loss of two heavyweight leaders, Abou Zeid and Mokhtar Belmokhtar, the source said. France launched a joint military campaign with some African armies in Mali in January to break Islamist rebels' hold on the region, saying the militants posed a risk to the security of West Africa and Europe.:19.248922:-3.010254:1364169060000:The Guardian,0.95:Mali,Abu Musab Abdel Wadoud,France,Abdelhamid Abou Zeid,Mokhtar Belmokhtar,Al-Qaida,Mauritania,Okacha
26:Two die in north London police chase:Two men have died following a police chase in north London. The pair were killed after the Audi they were travelling in jumped a red light, clipped a white van and hit a bridge. The driver was arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving and driving while disqualified after he tried to flee the scene at Seven Sisters Road in Haringey, Scotland Yard said. The two dead men have not been identified. They were killed after officers on routine patrol became suspicious of the Audi, which appeared to make off at speed when it was driven past police just before 2am on Friday. After several minutes searching for the car they spotted the vehicle several hundred yards away and sought to catch up, Scotland Yard said. The Audi was driven through a red light before it hit the van and crashed into the bridge. A police spokesman said. Two male passengers in the Audi, both believed to be aged in their late 20s or early 30s, were seriously injured. Officers gave CPR prior to the arrival of ambulances, but both were pronounced dead at the scene. Inquiries continue to establish the identity of the two men. The 30-year-old driver of the Audi tried to escape on foot before he was arrested. He was taken to hospital but his injuries are not believed to be serious. The driver of the white van was taken to hospital with minor injuries. Traffic officers are investigating the collision and roads surrounding the scene were closed on Friday morning. The Metropolitan police's directorate of professional standards has been informed.:51.569708:-0.097847:1364560320000:The Guardian,0.95:Audi,London,Scotland Yard,Seven Sisters Road,Friday,Causing death by dangerous driving,London Borough of Haringey,Car chase
27:Nelson Mandela 'making steady progress' in hospital:Nelson Mandela is in good spirits and making steady progress in hospital in South Africa, according to officials. The 94-year-old hero of the anti-apartheid struggle spent a second night receiving treatment for a recurring lung infection. His illness has cast a shadow over the Easter holiday. But Mac Maharaj, spokesman for the South African presidency, said. The presidency wishes to advise that former president Nelson Mandela is in good spirits and enjoyed a full breakfast this morning, 29 March 2013. The doctors report that he is making steady progress. He remains under treatment and observation in hospital. We would like to repeat our appeal for the media and the public to respect the privacy of Madiba and his family. The former president is believed to be at 1 Military Hospital in Pretoria and to have been visited by close family. This is his third stint in hospital in four months. President Jacob Zuma said people should slow down the anxiety about the health of the country's first black president, whom he referred to by his clan name, Madiba. Of course I have been saying to people, you should bear in mind Madiba is no longer that young and if he goes for check-ups every now and again, I don't think people must be alarmed about it, Zuma told the BBC on Thursday. I would like to really say the country must not panic. When asked if people should prepare for the inevitable, Zuma replied. In Zulu, when someone passes away who is very old, people say he or she has gone home. I think those are some of the things we should be thinking about. But he stressed that Mandela had been able to handle the situation very well so far. Very few outstanding personalities in the world live to his level, he added. Mandela was admitted for treatment shortly before midnight on Wednesday, his third stint in hospital in four months. He is believed to be at 1 Military Hospital in Pretoria and to have been visited by close family. Barack Obama led wellwishers around the world in expressing hope for his speedy recovery. The US president said he was deeply concerned with Nelson Mandela's health and we will be keeping him in our thoughts and prayers. He added. When you think of a single individual that embodies the kind of leadership qualities that I think we all aspire to, the first name that comes up is Nelson Mandela. And so we wish him all the very best. Obama said Mandela was as strong physically as he had been in leadership and character. His remarks came on Thursday as he met the leaders of Sierra Leone, Senegal, Malawi and Cape Verde. People around the world posted best wishes on Twitter. South African anti-apartheid activist Frank Chikane tweeted a call for prayers. As we enter the Easter weekend we should dedicate our prayers for Tata Mandela for his speedy recovery. Mandela has been mostly absent from the political scene for the past decade but remains a beloved symbol of the struggle against white-minority rule. He spent 27 years in prison, including 18 on Robben Island. He became South Africa's first black president after winning the country's first multiracial democratic election in 1994. Mandela has a history of lung problems dating to when he contracted tuberculosis as a political prisoner. He was in hospital briefly earlier this month for a check-up and spent nearly three weeks in hospital in December with a lung infection and after surgery to remove gallstones. That was his longest stay in hospital since his release from prison in 1990.:-25.728777:28.217697:1364562420000:The Guardian,0.95:South Africa,Nelson Mandela,Jacob Zuma,Barack Obama,Frank Chikane,Mac Maharaj,Robben Island,Sierra Leone
28:Easter Gets an Exemption From Spanish Austerity:Dolorés Gelo Suárez, a 70-year-old retired cleaner, lives alone in a home filled with religious decorations and relies on a state pension worth a few hundred euros a month. Still, she recently donated €14,000, or almost $18,000, to make a gold-laced tunic that will be worn by a statue of the Virgin Mary and then carried on Sunday by members of her religious brotherhood during one of Andalusia’s traditional Easter processions. Meanwhile in Olivares, a neighboring town of 9,500, another brotherhood was also preparing a Virgin statue for its Easter procession, this one adorned with a gold crown. The crown was made after melting down necklaces, rings, ancient coins and other gold objects worth tens of thousands of euros, after they were donated last year by 300 members of the brotherhood. Such fund-raising underlines the clout of the Roman Catholic Church, whose importance in Spain as a charitable institution has also been considerably enhanced by the country’s economic crisis and government spending cuts on social services. The newly elected Pope Francis has suggested the poor will be at the heart of his mission. But the crisis has also put strains on the church. Its fiscal privileges have been put under the spotlight. And the splendor of the Easter celebrations is viewed by some as out of sync with the dire economic conditions of the time. There is a debate about introducing more austerity in the Easter celebrations, probably fueled both by our economic crisis and the message of our new Pope, said María Roca, professor of religious law at the Complutense University in Madrid, as well as a legal adviser to the Spanish church. In fact, Miguel Luna, the secretary of the Olivares brotherhood that collected gold for the Virgin’s crown, said his organization found itself in an uncomfortable situation. On the one hand, it is deeply attached to its long held traditions — it celebrated its 300th anniversary last year. But it is also concerned about appearing ostentatious. Some members of the brotherhood opposed investing in the crown. Still, the crown should be understood as a very emotional transfer that people want to make to the Virgin, Mr. Luna said. It’s certainly not about trying to exhibit splendor and wealth at a time when the focus is on charity and austerity. The resilience of the donation-based financing model of the religious brotherhoods contrasts with the difficulties faced by many town halls, which have been buried in debt since the Spanish property bubble burst in 2008. The crisis hurts everybody, but a brotherhood is self-financed, has never depended on subsidies and simply spends what it can collect, said Gerardo Díaz, a member of another brotherhood, who also handles public finances as treasurer of the Olivares town hall. This Easter, for instance, Mr. Díaz’s brotherhood is assuming the cost of a tow truck to ensure that badly parked cars will not block the processions. The town normally pays that bill. In a country with a record jobless rate of 26 percent, the church has aggressively trumpeted its virtues as an employer. Last year, it began a recruitment drive for priests, with its television ad campaign arguing that joining the priesthood was a guarantee of a permanent job. For the brotherhoods, soaring joblessness has helped persuade more idle house painters, ceramic workers and other craftsmen to lend a hand in the time leading up to Easter celebrations. People have far less regular work, so that at least means more spare time to devote to our brotherhood, said Genoveva Rodríguez Sánchez, a seamstress who has made several embroideries for her brotherhood and has been setting aside one day a week to help prepare the Easter festivities. I think religious fervor has in any case been rising here every year, but this is also helping to maintain a long tradition of artistry that would otherwise go to waste during this crisis, she added. Among the 3,000 inhabitants of Albaida del Aljarafe, 509 people are registered as unemployed. Still, while 73 percent of Spaniards call themselves Catholics, the proportion who identify themselves as practicing the religion has declined steadily, down last year to 18 percent, according to Metroscopia, a polling agency. That compared with 31 percent in 1988 and 48 percent in 1976, the year after the dictator Francisco Franco died. Meanwhile, the crisis has also brought more attention to the economic advantages of the church, particularly its exemption from most property tax under a 1979 agreement signed between Spain and the Vatican. The church also benefited from a 1998 legislative act that allowed dioceses to register as their property churches and other buildings that they had long used but not officially owned.:37.426275:-6.164575:1364428800000:New York Times,0.92:Easter,Francisco Franco,Andalusia,Madrid,Holidays,Religion and Spirituality,Christianity,Calendar
29:Taliban Spread Terror in Karachi as the New Gang in Town:This seaside metropolis is no stranger to gangland violence, driven for years by a motley collection of armed groups who battle over money, turf and votes. But there is a new gang in town. Hundreds of miles from their homeland in the mountainous northwest, Pakistani Taliban fighters have started to flex their muscles more forcefully in parts of this vast city, and they are openly taking ground. Taliban gunmen have mounted guerrilla assaults on police stations, killing scores of officers. They have stepped up extortion rackets that target rich businessmen and traders, and shot dead public health workers engaged in polio vaccination efforts. In some neighborhoods, Taliban clerics have started to mediate disputes through a parallel judicial system. The grab for influence and power in Karachi shows that the Taliban have been able to extend their reach across Pakistan, even here in the country's most populous city, with about 20 million inhabitants. No longer can they be written off as endemic only to the country's frontier regions. In joining Karachi's street wars, the Taliban are upending a long-established network of competing criminal, ethnic and political armed groups in this combustible city. The difference is that the Taliban's agenda is more expansive — it seeks to overthrow the Pakistani state — and their operations are run by remote control from the tribal belt along the Afghan border. Already, the militants have reshaped the city's political balance by squeezing one of the most prominent political machines, the Pashtun-dominated Awami National Party, off its home turf. They have scared Awami operatives out of town and destroyed offices, gravely undercutting the party's chances in national elections scheduled for May. We are the Taliban's first enemy, said Shahi Syed, the party's provincial head, at his newly fortified office. They burn my offices, they tear down my flags and they kill our people. The Taliban drift into Karachi actually began years ago, though much more quietly. Many fled here after a concerted Pakistani military operation in the Swat Valley in 2009. The influx has gradually continued, officials here say, with Taliban fighters able to easily melt into the city's population of fellow ethnic Pashtuns, estimated to number at least five million people. Until recently, the militants saw Karachi as a kind of rear base, using the city to lie low or seek medical treatment, and limiting their armed activities to criminal fund-raising, like kidnapping and bank robberies. But for at least six months now, there have been signs that their timidity is disappearing. The Taliban have become a force on the street, aggressively exerting their influence in the ethnic Pashtun quarters of the city. Taliban tactics are most evident in Manghopir, an impoverished neighborhood of rough, cinder-block houses clustered around marble quarries on the northern edge of the city, where illegal housing settlements spill into the surrounding desert. In recent months, Taliban militants have attacked the Manghopir police station three times, killing eight officers, said Muhammad Aadil Khan, a local member of Parliament. In interviews, residents describe Taliban militants who roam on motorbikes or in jeeps with tinted windows, delivering extortion demands in the shape of two bullets wrapped in a piece of paper. A factory owner in Manghopir, speaking on the condition of anonymity out of fear for his safety, said that several Pashtun businessmen had received demands for $10,000 to $50,000. The figure was negotiable, he said, but payment was not. resistance could result in an assault on the victim's house or, in the worst case, a bullet to the head. Mr. Khan said he had not dared to visit his constituency in months. There is a personal threat against me, he said, speaking at the headquarters of his party, the Muttahida Qaumi Movement, which represents ethnic Mohajirs, in the city center. The militant drive has even distressed Manghopir's most revered residents. the dozens of crocodiles who inhabit a pool near a Sufi shrine here. The Muslim pilgrims who come here to pay homage to the shrine's saint have long also brought scraps of meat for his reptile charges. But lately, as visitor numbers have dwindled from hundreds per day to barely a few dozen, the roughly 120 crocodiles here have grown hungry, according to the animals' elderly caretaker.:24.888928:67.028961:1364428800000:New York Times,0.92:Manghopir,Karachi,Pakistan,Awami National Party,Taliban,Muttahida Qaumi Movement,Pashtun people,Pakistani
30:For a Night, Iraqis Root for the Home Team, and the Visitors:Iraq's national soccer team played Syria on the greenest patch of grass in Baghdad the other night, under bright lights that mostly stayed lighted, before tens of thousands of Iraqis cheering on their own and the Syrians, too. The fans roared when the Syrian team emerged from its dressing room, and roared again after it scored a goal in the second half. Syria, Syria remains in our heart! was one chant. Bashar, Bashar remains in our heart! was another. Up high in a glass-enclosed suite, where ministers, members of Parliament and their well-connected hangers-on took in the game, two Syrian men in the front row had draped themselves in the flag of their embattled country and were holding placards of their president, Bashar al-Assad. Iraq was also subject to terrorism, said one of the men, Yasir Dandah, 19, referring to the Syrian government's portrayal of the uprising against Mr. Assad as a wave of terrorism. That is why they are sympathetic to us. Left unsaid was that many of the insurgents who flooded into Iraq during its own civil war came from Syria. But now that Syria finds itself in the middle of its own bloody civil war, many of Iraq's Shiites, a majority here, have sided with the Syrian government as it fights a Sunni-led rebellion. That sentiment found its expression on Tuesday night in the chants of the fans, who seemed as intent on welcoming the visitors as on cheering for the home team. It seemed almost incidental that Iraq beat Syria, 2-1. Down in the cheap seats, vendors worked the crowd, selling cigarettes and nuts and ice cream bars from plastic foam coolers. Syrians are our brothers, said one fan, Ali Hadi, 23, as the teams warmed up. Days earlier, FIFA, soccer's international governing body, lifted the ban on international competition in Baghdad but only for friendly matches for now. The restriction had been in place because of fears of violence and worries that Iraq's shaky electrical grid would not keep the field illuminated long enough to complete a game. Neither problem materialized on Tuesday night. The crowd was kept safe by a heavy security presence that included heavily armed soldiers patrolling the crowd, armored vehicles ringing the stadium and helicopters buzzing overhead. A brief failure of one of the lighting towers during the second half not unlike what happened at the Superdome in New Orleans during the Super Bowl last month was explained by officials as an act of sabotage and not a problem with the electrical system, and the teams played on. For everyone, it seemed, the game meant more than just the action on the field. It means everything, Abdul Kadar Shamki, an official with the Iraq Football Association, said of the game's importance. Football for Iraq means everything. Gesturing toward the sea of people and the thousands of fluttering black, red and white Iraqi flags, Mr. Shamki said. You don't know who is Sunni or Shia or Christian. They are just chanting for Iraq. The fans also cheered for something more, at one point breaking into the chant, Sunnis and Shiites, we are all brothers! Here, as elsewhere, sports links generations and soothes the vicissitudes of life. So on a pleasant spring evening, a week after nearly 20 car bombs struck around the city, killing dozens, almost 50,000 people came to dilapidated Shaab Stadium, which was built in the 1960s as a gift from a Portuguese foundation and more recently served as a base for American soldiers. Hours before the game, fans began showing up to buy tickets. Those that could not get in jammed cafes around the city to watch, or listened on the radio, stuck in traffic. Some said that the cheers of support for the Syrians were as much an expression of Arab hospitality toward a visitor as taking sides in a civil war. Iraqis have a sports soul, said Samer Edaan, 56, who manages a soccer team for police officers in a local league, as he sat in the V.I.P. suite before the game. We have to cheer up our guests, he said. If Syria scores they will cheer because they are our guests. As a boy, Mr. Edaan went to the opening of the stadium in 1966 for a match between Iraq and a club from Lisbon that was attended, he said, by Iraq's president at the time. I cried because of my happiness when I walked in to the stadium today, Mr. Edaan said. In the suite, a man wearing a dishdasha, the traditional gown, and an Arab headdress walked among the high-powered fans pouring sips of bitter coffee from a golden spout into tiny porcelain cups. Standing amid the crowd was Mehdi Jassim, well known in Iraq for leading cheers during games. In the 1960s, he used to sell nuts at games with his uncle and also recalled being at the opening of the stadium, when the Iraqis lost to the Portuguese. For years, amid the violence that engulfed the country, Iraq's national team played mostly abroad, with one exception being a friendly match against the Palestinians in 2009. It's like a lover has returned, Mr. Jassim said. It brings my soul back again, to see the people and the cheering and the energy and the flag of one Iraq.:33.32307:44.422359:1364428800000:New York Times,0.92:Iraq,Syria,Baghdad,Bashar al-Assad,Iraq Football Association,Syrian,Sunni,Syrian people
