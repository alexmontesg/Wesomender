1:New Zealand v England. Alastair Cook's side face series defeat:England face a humiliating series defeat after slumping to 90-4 on the fourth day of the third and final Test against New Zealand in Auckland. The tourists lost captain Alastair Cook for 43 and night-watchman Steven Finn to poor shots in the closing stages. England were set a record target of 481 to win in 143 overs. Opener Peter Fulton (110) became only the fourth New Zealander to hit hundreds in the same Test as the hosts declared on 241-6 at Eden Park. England's reply got off to a terrible start when Nick Compton was caught behind off Tim Southee, but they were handed a reprieve when wicketkeeper BJ Watling dropped Cook off a difficult low chance. England appeared to have steadied the ship but then Jonathan Trott swiped at a wide delivery from Neil Wagner and edged to Watling for 37. New Zealand struck their biggest blow when Cook attempted an attacking drive off part-time spinner Kane Williamson and only succeeded in sending a thick edge to slip and was caught for 43. Finn, surrounded by eight close fielders, followed in the day's last over when he rashly reached for another teasing Williamson delivery and was superbly caught at gully for a duck. That left Ian Bell as the not-out batsman, having made eight off 89 balls, and he will need to maintain his defiance on the final day to give England any hope of avoiding defeat.:-36.837866:174.760895:1364188140:BBC,1:New Zealand,Kane Williamson,Peter Fulton,England,Alastair Cook,Jonathan Trott,Steven Finn,BJ Watling
2:Cyprus bailout. Deal reached in Eurogroup talks:Eurozone finance ministers have agreed a 10bn-euro bailout deal for Cyprus to prevent its banking system collapsing and keep the country in the eurozone. Laiki (Popular) Bank - the country's second-biggest - will be wound down and deposit-holders with more than 100,000 euros ($130,000; £85,000) will face big losses. However, all deposits under 100,000 euros will be "fully guaranteed". The European Central Bank had set a deadline of Monday for a deal. Laiki will be split into "good" and "bad" banks, with its good assets eventually merged into Bank of Cyprus. The president of the Eurogroup of eurozone finance ministers, Jeroen Dijsselbloem, told a press conference in Brussels the deal had "put an end to the uncertainty" around Cyprus's economy.He added he was "convinced" the new deal was better for the Cypriot people than the broader measure rejected by the Cypriot parliament last week, as it focused on two problem banks rather than the entire sector. IMF head Christine Lagarde said the deal was "a comprehensive and credible plan" to help restore trust in the banking system. Cypriot Finance Minister Michalis Sarris said he believed the possibility of bankruptcy had been averted. "It's not that we won a battle, but we really have avoided a disastrous exit from the eurozone," he said.:50.11041:8.673084:1364198220:BBC,1:Cyprus,European Central Bank,Jeroen Dijsselbloem,Christine Lagarde,Brussels,International Monetary Fund,Eurogroup,Eurozone
3:Carlsen & Aronian still tied for first place at FIDE Candidates, Kramnik now a point behind:Magnus Carlsen of Norway and Levon Aronian of Armenia are still tied for first place after eight rounds at the FIDE World Chess Candidates' Tournament in London. The leaders of the tournament faced each other over the board on Sunday and drew a Catalan game in just an hour and a half. Vladimir Kramnik of Russia, who beat his compatriot Peter Svidler in a Grünfeld, is now one point behind the two. Like Kramnik, Boris Gelfand of Israel won his first game of the tournament. He defeated Teimour Radjabov of Azerbaijan by adopting the strong positional concept 13...e5! in an English game. For the third time already in this tournament, Ukrainian Vassily Ivanchuk lost on time, in this round against Alexander Grischuk of Russia. On Sunday the second half of the FIDE World Chess Candidates' Tournament started with a big game. Magnus Carlsen versus Levon Aronian, the two leaders of the tournament. In the first round they drew against each other, and if either player would have won this one, he would have been "huge favourite", as Carlsen put it the day before. One reason is that if two players tie for first place after the last round, the first tie-break rule is the individual result. Somewhat expectedly, neither player wanted to take too much risk and as a result the game quickly petered out to a draw. "I thought that Magnus was not going to take much risk and play solid," said Aronian. Carlsen. "I was just trying to play more or less solidly, trying to put some pressure without taking too much risk. It felt like the natural thing to do in such a situation. He played precisely in the opening." Thanks to good preparation Aronian quickly equalized in a Catalan. However, in a very equal ending Carlsen declined a draw offer, somewhere around move 33. "I thought there was no harm in playing a few more moves. But at that point both of us knew what was going to happen anyway!" As the players explained, such quick draws are part of the game. "As in the whole tournament, you don't really want to lose any game, but this one particularly. In this tournament situation it would mean a lot. You have to try and take your chances when you can," said Aronian. "In general with Black in such tournaments that's the way you play. You try and play solid and if there are chances, you take them, otherwise… You know, the players here are so strong that it's not easy to win any game," said Carlsen. In this round Boris Gelfand won his first game of the tournament. He defeated Teimour Radjabov without much effort, thanks to a powerful new idea in the English opening on move 13. "It's a big positional concept. It cuts both the bishop on g2 and the knight on b3," explained Gelfand afterwards. Radjabov never really got into the game. "Somehow I didn't find a way to execute the g4-g5 plan. I was surprised that I had to play for equality. I was only right about my estimation, not about my moves." Gelfand, who didn't need much time on the clock. "I know that I am better and I know what I have to do, that's why I played very quickly. The problem is on white's shoulders." Not long afterwards Vladimir Kramnik also won his first game. After seven draws, the Russian grandmaster beat his compatriot Peter Svidler in a variation of the Grünfeld in which Kramnik also beat Garry Kasparov, 13 years ago, in their World Championship match, also in London. "Now it became clear why Kasparov dropped the Grünfeld after game 2 in our match. Finally I showed the refutation of this opening!" joked Kramnik, which put a little smile even on Svidler's face. On a more serious note, the former World Champion said he analysed his idea 14.Kc2 already during that match. Until recently he didn't think it was worth trying, but he discovered that "Black in fact has to be very accurate". Svidler's 14…Ne5 (instead of the more standard 14…Na5 which Kramnik had surely looked at thoroughly) was a good practical decision. But spending half an hour on it wasn't. "If you're going to play 14…Ne5 you have to do it immediately," said Svider. As it went, Kramnik got a slight advantage but Black was solid and without time trouble Svidler might have defended better. From move 30 onwards he started to play inaccurately, and with a few strong moves Kramnik could score the full point. "In fact I thought that my victory was yesterday because after this absolutely awful, unexplainable blunder which I made, I was forgiven and I somehow considered it as a good sign. I still cannot explain how I managed to make such a blunder but I think it was a turning point, at least I hope so, that I start to get luck on my side and start to go on with full force, let's see," said Kramnik. The game between Alexander Grischuk and Vassily Ivanchuk finished dramatically. It was a Sicilian Dragon and the position was always more or less equal, but, staying true to their "style", both players got into time trouble. Ivanchuk didn't make the time control yet again. At the press conference Grischuk revealed that the last time he won a classical game in a World Championship or Candidates event was "6 years and about 25-26 games ago" – his win against Gelfand in Mexico 2007. Grischuk. "It was like Gabriel Garcia Marquez' One Hundred Years of Solitude, but for me it was six years of suffering!" Asked about the time control in London (40 moves in 2 hours, then 20 moves in 1 hour and then 15 minutes plus 30 seconds increment from move 61), Grischuk said. "Where you have a move limit, it's correct that you don't have increment. It's your own responsibility that you think about the time. But at the end of the game it's correct to have increment because otherwise it can go on and on. The problem is that we are all spoilt by the fact that most tournaments are held with increment. It's difficult to switch. But I think this is the right time control." Ivanchuk's response to the same question was. "It's a matter of taste. I cannot say there is a time control that everybody likes." The Ukrainian was quite upset about what was already his third loss on time, and preferred to answer questions from the press separately from his opponent. Ivanchuk's very correct play at the board should be mentioned, though. in the heat of the moment, with just four seconds left on the clock for four moves, he accidentally knocked over one of his opponent's pawns. Where many players would (incorrectly) press the clock first and then quickly put back the pawn, the Ukrainian (correctly) did this in his own time. But then "there was no way for him to make the time control," as one of the arbiters said. After eight rounds, Carlsen and Aronian are still tied for first place with 5.5 points. Vladimir Kramnik is one point behind with 4.5 while Grischuk is in 4th place with 4 points. Gelfand and Svidler are shared 5th with 3.5 points, Radjabov is in 7th place with 3 points and Ivanchuk is last with 2.5 points. Monday, March 25th at 14.00 GMT the ninth round will be played.

4:Greece is no Ireland, says banking group as bailout stalls:The Institute of International Finance (IIF) has called for more money to be poured into Greece for it to emulate Ireland's success, warning that a failure to do so would end up costing more.Its caution came as talks between Greece and its troika of international creditors - the EU, European Central Bank and International Monetary Fund - were put on hold due to "outstanding issues", largely around clashes over civil service job cuts.Approval from the troika, who will resume talks with Athens in early April, will be needed to release a further €2.8bn to the troubled economy, originally scheduled for the end of March. Despite the delay, Yannis Stournaras, Greek Finance Minister, said he considered the loan tranche as "secure".While in Ireland "consolidation measures have been painful but more manageable politically and socially", the targets set for Greece "were not achievable", said Jeffrey Anderson, senior European director for the IIF in a research note."Applying the Irish example in Greece to help restart growth would require some additional funding," he said, adding that the final cost "would be much less than might eventually be needed if [Greek] output continues to fall and doubts about debt sustainability remain entrenched.":50.11041:8.673084:1363276260:The Telegraph,1:Greece,European Central Bank,Athens,International Monetary Fund,Yannis Stournaras,Ireland,European Union,Institute of International Finance
5:EU finance ministers approve Cyprus bailout deal, avoiding bankruptcy:Cyprus' Parliament president says a 10 billion euro ($13 billion) package of rescue loans secured by his country in tense, last-ditch negotiations is a "painful one," although the bailout saved the country from a banking system collapse and bankruptcy.Yiannakis Omirou said Monday that Cyprus must work fast to reform its economy and leave the bailout as soon as possible.The deal reached in Brussels early Monday prevented Cyprus' imminent financial meltdown by securing the bailout on the condition that the country cut back its banking sector and force large losses on big deposits to help pay much of the bill.Without a bailout deal by Monday night, the tiny Mediterranean nation would have faced the prospect of bankruptcy, which could have forced it to become the first country to abandon the euro currency. That would have sent the region's markets spinning."It's not that we won a battle, but we really have avoided a disastrous exit from the eurozone," said Cyprus Finance Minister Michalis Sarris.The eurozone finance ministers accepted the plan after hours of negotiations in Brussels between Cypriot officials and the so-called troika of creditors -- the International Monetary Fund, the European Commission and the ECB."We believe that this will form a lasting, durable and fully financed solution," said IMF chief Christine Lagarde.To secure the rescue loan package, the Cypriot government had to find ways to raise 5.8 billion euros ($7.5 billion) on its own. The bulk of that money is now being raised by forcing losses on large bank deposit holders, with the remainder coming from tax increases and privatizations.Cyprus must drastically shrink its banking sector, cut its budget, implement structural reforms and privatize state assets, said Jeroen Dijsselbloem, who chairs the meetings of the eurozone's finance ministers. The country's second-largest bank, Laiki, will be restructured, with all bond holders and people with more than 100,000 euros in their bank accounts there facing significant losses.The measures are likely to deepen the recession in Cyprus.The cash-strapped island nation has been shut out of international markets for almost two years. It first applied for a bailout to recapitalize its ailing lenders and keep the government afloat last June, but the political negotiations stalled. After a botched agreement last week, the ECB threatened to cut off emergency assistance to the country's banks."We've put an end to the uncertainty that has affected Cyprus and the euro area over the past week," Dijsselbloem said.That uncertainty around the tiny nation of about 800,000 had shaken the entire eurozone of 300 million people, even though Cyprus only makes up less than 0.2 percent of the eurozone's economy.Several national parliaments in eurozone countries such as Germany must also approve the bailout deal, which might take another few weeks. EU officials said they expect the whole program to be approved by mid-April.The country's second-largest bank, Laiki, will be dissolved immediately into a bad bank containing its uninsured deposits and toxic assets, with the guaranteed deposits being transferred to the nation's biggest lender, Bank of Cyprus.Dijsselbloem said it was not yet clear how severe the losses would be to Laiki's large bank deposit holders, but he noted that it is expected to yield 4.2 billion euros overall -- or much of the money that Cyprus needed to raise to secure the bailout. Analysts have estimated investors might lose up to 40 percent of their money.Large deposits with Bank of Cyprus above the insured level will be frozen until it becomes clear whether or to what extent they will also be forced to take losses, the Eurogroup of finance ministers said in a statement.Dijsselbloem defended the creditors' approach of making deposit holders take heavy losses, saying the measures "will be concentrated where the problems are, in the large banks."The international creditors, led by the IMF, were seeking a fundamental restructuring of the country's outsized financial system, which is worth up to eight times the Cypriot gross domestic product of about 18 billion euros. They said the country's business model of attracting foreign investors, among them many Russians, with low taxes and lax financial regulation had backfired and needed to be upended.The drastic shrinking of the financial sector, the wiping out of wealth through the losses on deposits, the loss of confidence with the recent turmoil and the upcoming austerity measures all mean that Cyprus is facing tough times."The near future will be very difficult for the country and its people," acknowledged the EU Commission's top economic official, Olli Rehn. "But (the measures) will be necessary for the Cypriot people to rebuild their economy on a new basis."Cypriot banks have been closed this past week while officials worked on a rescue plan, and they are not due to reopen until Tuesday. Cash has been available through ATMs, but long lines formed and many machines have quickly run out of cash.Amid fears of a banking collapse, Cyprus' central bank on Sunday imposed a daily withdrawal limit of 100 euros ($130) from ATMs of the country's two largest banks to prevent a bank run by depositors worried about their savings.The Cypriot government also approved a set of laws over the past week to introduce capital controls, in order to avoid a huge depositor flight once banks reopen.Creditors had insisted that Cyprus couldn't receive more loans because that would make its debt burden unsustainably high. The IMF's Lagarde said Cyprus would now reach a debt level of about 100 percent of GDP by 2020.A plan agreed to in marathon negotiations earlier this month called for a one-time levy on all bank depositors in Cypriot banks. But the proposal ignited fierce anger because it also targeted small savers. It failed to win a single vote in the Cypriot Parliament.Cyprus' bid to secure more financial aid from its long-time ally, Russia, then failed, forcing it to turn again to its European partners. Russia was expected, however, to extend a 2.5 billion euro emergency loan granted last year, also lowering the interest rate due and extending the repayment schedule.:35.171283:33.364449:1363276260:Fox,0.7:Cyprus,International Monetary Fund,Bank of Cyprus,Jeroen Dijsselbloem,European Commission,Olli Rehn,Cypriot,Automated teller machine
6:Jose back at Chelsea. But Rafa has no need to panic... yet!:The Special One is due back at Stamford Bridge for the first time since 2011. But not, as Blues fans hope, to replace the reviled interim boss Rafa Benitez. Not yet anyway. Mourinho has accepted an invitation from the Brazilian FA to tonight's glamorous friendly against Fabio Capello's Russia. So he will be back at Chelsea for the first time since he knocked them out of the Champions League with Inter Milan, two years ago. Mourinho's surprise return to SW6, where he won six trophies between 2004-07, will spark more speculation about him returning for real in the summer. He looks certain to leave current club Real Madrid in the summer. The Portuguese coach has never hidden his love for Chelsea and English football. And only this weekend he hinted he could go back to maybe somewhere I've already been - raising hope among Blues fans he could mean Chelsea. There will be a vacancy, too, as the reign of Benitez ends in May. But Chelsea's billionaire owner Roman Abramovich faces stiff competition. Two-time Champions League winner Mourinho has also been linked with AC Milan, Manchester City and Paris Saint-Germain. Newcastle legend Alan Shearer would be delighted to see Mourinho return. The SunSport columnist said Love him or hate him - and I love him - Jose adds something to the soap opera of English football.If his destiny proves to be Stamford Bridge once more, then it really will be game on with the Manchester clubs.:51.481263:-0.190544:1363222260:The Sun,0.5:Stamford Bridge,Roman Abramovich,Chelsea FC,José Mourinho,Rafael Benítez,Fabio Capello,Inter Milan,Alan Shearer
